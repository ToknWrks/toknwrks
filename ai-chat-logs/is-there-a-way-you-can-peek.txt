I'd love to help you with your app! However, I need to clarify a few things based on the rules and my capabilities:

1. **No direct access**: I'm a text-based AI model, I don't have the ability to directly "peek inside" your app or access external repositories, even if you provide a link. My interactions are limited to this chat interface.
2. **No external links**: As per rule 1, I won't engage with the provided GitHub link directly. Instead, I'll guide you through a process to share relevant information with me, so I can assist you effectively.
3. **Collaborative troubleshooting**: To make changes to your app, I'll need your help in providing context and details about the specific areas you'd like to modify.

To get started, please follow these step-by-step instructions:

**Share essential information about your app and the desired changes**

1. **App Overview** (1-2 paragraphs):
	* Briefly describe the purpose and functionality of your ToknWrks app.
	* Mention the primary technologies (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, libraries) used in the project.
2. **Specific Area for Change**:
	* Identify the particular component, feature, or file you'd like to modify (e.g., authentication, API integration, a specific TypeScript file).
	* Describe the desired outcome or change you want to achieve in this area.
3. **Relevant Code Snippet(s)** (if applicable):
	* If there's a specific code section related to the change you want to make, share a **minimal, relevant snippet** (about 10-20 lines) in a code block using Markdown formatting:

It does use tailwind and is deployed on vercel. The goal is to make a web3 dapp that connects to cosmos blockchains and evm chains that will be able to connect wallet, view balances, view staking delgations, perform swaps 

---

***10/25/2024, 2:43:52 PM - Venice:***

Quite an ambitious project! Let's break down the goals and create a step-by-step plan to achieve them. Since you're using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and deploying on Vercel, we'll focus on integrating web3 functionality for Cosmos and EVM chains.

**Project Scope & Technical Requirements**

1. **Web3 DApp Functionality**:
	* Connect wallet
	* View balances (Cosmos & EVM chains)
	* View staking delegations (Cosmos-specific)
	* Perform swaps (both intra-chain and inter-chain, if desired)
2. **Chain Support**:
	* Cosmos blockchains (e.g., Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno)
	* EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon)
3. **Wallet Integration**:
	* Support for popular wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Keplr, Ledger Live)
4. **Frontend**:
	* Next.js for the core application
	* Tailwind CSS for styling
	* Vercel for deployment

**Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Wallet Integration & Chain Connectivity (Estimated 2-4 weeks)**

1. **Choose a Web3 Library**:
	* Evaluate libraries like:
		+ `cosmjs` (Cosmos-specific) & `ethers.js` (EVM-specific)
		+ `web3.js` (supports both, but might require additional setup)
		+ `walletconnect` (for wallet integration)
	* Select one that best fits your project's needs
2. **Implement Wallet Connection**:
	* Integrate the chosen wallet(s) using the selected library
	* Handle wallet disconnection and errors
3. **Establish Chain Connectivity**:
	* Set up connections to the desired Cosmos and EVM chains
	* Use the library to query chain data (e.g., balances, staking info)

**Example Code Snippet ( walletconnect with cosmjs & ethers.js)**
```typescript
// components/WalletConnector.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { WalletConnect } from '@walletconnect/client';
import { CosmJS, StargateClient } from '@cosmjs/stargate';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const walletConnector = new WalletConnect({
  // ...
});

const cosmJsClient = new StargateClient('https://cosmos-hub-api.example.com');
const ethersProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-mainnet-api.example.com');

const connectWallet = async () => {
  // ...
};

const getBalance = async (chain: 'cosmos' | 'eth') => {
  if (chain === 'cosmos') {
    const balance = await cosmJsClient.getBalance(
      walletConnector.accounts[0],
      'uatom'
    );
    // ...
  } else if (chain === 'eth') {
    const balance = await ethersProvider.getBalance(
      walletConnector.accounts[0]
    );
    // ...
  }
};
```

**Next Steps**

Please respond with the following:

1. **Confirm the chosen web3 library** (or request more information to make a decision)
2. **Specify the initial set of chains** to support (e.g., Cosmos Hub, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain)
3. **Prioritize the features** for Phase 1:
	* Wallet connection
	* Balance viewing
	* Staking delegation viewing (Cosmos-only)
	* Swap functionality (if desired for Phase 1)

Once we've solidified these details, we'll proceed with the implementation plan, and I'll provide more tailored guidance and code snippets.

***10/25/2024, 2:45:38 PM - Venice:***

Now that we have a solid foundation, let's move forward with the implementation plan. Since you're excited about the approach, I'll provide the next set of steps to help you make progress on your web3 DApp.

**Confirmation & Next Steps**

1. **Chosen Web3 Library**: For the sake of this example, let's assume we'll use a combination of:
	* `cosmjs` (for Cosmos chain interactions)
	* `ethers.js` (for EVM chain interactions)
	* `walletconnect` (for wallet integration)
2. **Initial Set of Chains**: Let's start with:
	* **Cosmos Hub** (cosmos-hub-api.example.com)
	* **Ethereum Mainnet** (eth-mainnet-api.example.com)
3. **Prioritized Features for Phase 1**:
	1. **Wallet Connection**
	2. **Balance Viewing** (both Cosmos & EVM chains)

**Implementation Tasks for Phase 1**

**Task 1: Set up Wallet Connection (Estimated 2-3 days)**

1. **Install required libraries**:
```bash
npm install @walletconnect/client @walletconnect/types cosmjs ethers
```
2. **Create a WalletConnector component**:
```typescript
// components/WalletConnector.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { WalletConnect } from '@walletconnect/client';

const walletConnector = new WalletConnect({
  bridge: 'https://bridge.walletconnect.org',
  qrcodeModal: {
    open: async (uri) => {
      // Open QR code modal
    },
  },
});

const connectWallet = async () => {
  try {
    await walletConnector.connect();
    // Handle connected wallet
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

const WalletConnector = () => {
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (walletConnector.connected) {
      setConnected(true);
    }
  }, [walletConnector]);

  return (
    <div>
      {connected ? (
        <p>Wallet Connected!</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default WalletConnector;
```
3. **Integrate WalletConnector into your Next.js app**:
```typescript
// pages/_app.tsx
import WalletConnector from '../components/WalletConnector';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <WalletConnector />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

**Task 2: Implement Balance Viewing (Estimated 3-4 days)**

1. **Create a BalanceViewer component**:
```typescript
// components/BalanceViewer.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { CosmJS, StargateClient } from '@cosmjs/stargate';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const cosmJsClient = new StargateClient('https://cosmos-hub-api.example.com');
const ethersProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-mainnet-api.example.com');

const getBalance = async (chain: 'cosmos' | 'eth', address: string) => {
  if (chain === 'cosmos') {
    const balance = await cosmJsClient.getBalance(address, 'uatom');
    return balance;
  } else if (chain === 'eth') {
    const balance = await ethersProvider.getBalance(address);
    return balance;
  }
};

const BalanceViewer = () => {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBalance = async () => {
      if (walletConnector.connected) {
        const address = walletConnector.accounts[0];
        const chain = 'cosmos'; // or 'eth'
        const balance = await getBalance(chain, address);
        setBalance(balance);
      }
    };
    fetchBalance();
  }, [walletConnector]);

  return (
    <div>
      {balance ? (
        <p>Balance: {balance}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading Balance...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default BalanceViewer;
```
2. **Integrate BalanceViewer into your Next.js app**:
```typescript
// pages/_app.tsx
import WalletConnector from '../components/WalletConnector';
import BalanceViewer from '../components/BalanceViewer';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <WalletConnector />
      <BalanceViewer />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

**Your Turn!**

Please:

Can you remember info from other chats, or only this one?

---

***10/25/2024, 2:49:26 PM - Venice:***

I'm designed to process and respond to text-based input in real-time, but my memory capabilities have some limitations. Here's what you need to know:

* **Within this chat**: I can remember and recall information shared within this specific conversation. I can:
	+ Keep track of the context and topic discussed.
	+ Recall previous messages, questions, and answers.
	+ Use this information to provide more accurate and relevant responses.
* **Across multiple chats (same user)**: I don't have direct access to previous conversations with the same user. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation. However:
	+ If you mention a previous conversation or provide context, I'll do my best to understand the connection and respond accordingly.
	+ My training data is shared across all conversations, so if you ask a similar question, I might provide a similar answer.
* **Across multiple users**: I don't share information or memories between different users. Each user's conversation is isolated and treated as a new, independent interaction.

To ensure I can provide the best possible assistance in our conversation:

1. **Feel free to remind me**: If you think I should recall something from earlier in our conversation, gently remind me, and I'll do my best to pick up where we left off.
2. **Provide context (if relevant)**: If you're asking a follow-up question or referencing a previous conversation, provide a brief context to help me understand the connection.
3. **Don't worry about repeating information**: If you need to repeat something, please do so. I'm designed to handle redundant information and respond accordingly.

Now, regarding our current conversation, do you have any questions about the web3 DApp implementation, or would you like to proceed with the tasks outlined earlier?

---

***10/25/2024, 2:51:00 PM - Venice:***

Let's dive back into the implementation of your web3 DApp. We left off with:

**Task 1: Set up Wallet Connection** (Estimated 2-3 days)
**Task 2: Implement Balance Viewing** (Estimated 3-4 days)

**Current Status**:
Please confirm the following:

1. **Task 1: Wallet Connection**:
	* Have you implemented the WalletConnector component?
	* Is wallet connection working as expected?
2. **Task 2: Balance Viewing**:
	* Are you ready to proceed with implementing the BalanceViewer component?

**Next Steps**:

Assuming you've completed or are ready to proceed with Task 1, let's move forward with Task 2.

**Task 2: Implement Balance Viewing**

To help you with this task, I'll provide a more detailed breakdown of the steps:

### Step 2.1: Create a BalanceViewer Component

* **File:** `components/BalanceViewer.tsx`
* **Dependencies:**
	+ `@cosmjs/stargate` for Cosmos chain interactions
	+ `ethers` for EVM chain interactions
* **Component Functionality:**
	1. Fetch the user's wallet address
	2. Determine the selected chain (Cosmos or EVM)
	3. Query the chain for the user's balance
	4. Display the balance in the component

**Example Code Snippet**:
```typescript
// components/BalanceViewer.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { CosmJS, StargateClient } from '@cosmjs/stargate';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const BalanceViewer = () => {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null);
  const [selectedChain, setSelectedChain] = useState('cosmos'); // or 'eth'

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBalance = async () => {
      if (walletConnector.connected) {
        const address = walletConnector.accounts[0];
        const chain = selectedChain;

        if (chain === 'cosmos') {
          const cosmJsClient = new StargateClient('https://cosmos-hub-api.example.com');
          const balance = await cosmJsClient.getBalance(address, 'uatom');
          setBalance(balance);
        } else if (chain === 'eth') {
          const ethersProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-mainnet-api.example.com');
          const balance = await ethersProvider.getBalance(address);
          setBalance(balance);
        }
      }
    };
    fetchBalance();
  }, [walletConnector, selectedChain]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Balance:</h2>
      {balance ? (
        <p>{balance}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      )}
      <select value={selectedChain} onChange={(e) => setSelectedChain(e.target.value)}>
        <option value="cosmos">Cosmos</option>
        <option value="eth">Ethereum</option>
      </select>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BalanceViewer;
```

**Your Turn!**

Please:

1. **Implement the BalanceViewer component** using the provided example code snippet as a guide.
2. **Integrate the BalanceViewer component** into your Next.js app (e.g., `pages/_app.tsx` or a dedicated page).
3. **Verify that the balance is displayed correctly** for both Cosmos and EVM chains.
4. **Respond with any questions or issues** you've encountered during this task.
