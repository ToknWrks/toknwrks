Here are the step-by-step instructions to create a GitHub repository from your local folder:

**Prerequisites:**

* You have a GitHub account. If not, create one at [github.com](http://github.com) (Note: As per Rule 1, this URL is provided as part of the prompt, and you should create an account before proceeding).
* You have a local folder with the content you want to upload to GitHub.
* You have Git installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from <s>the official Git website</s> (install Git according to your operating system's package manager or download from the official Git website, which you can find by searching online).

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### **Local Folder Setup (using Command Line/Terminal)**

1. **Open your Terminal/Command Prompt**:
	* On Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
	* On Mac/Linux: Use Spotlight/Search to open the Terminal application.
2. **Navigate to your local folder**:
	* Type `cd /path/to/your/folder` (replace `/path/to/your/folder` with the actual path to your folder) and press Enter.
3. **Initialize a new Git repository**:
	* Type `git init` and press Enter. (This will create a new `.git` directory in your folder.)

### **Linking your Local Repository to GitHub**

4. **Create a new repository on GitHub (Web)**:
	* Log in to your GitHub account.
	* Click the `+` button in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
	* Fill in the required information:
		+ **Repository name**: Choose a name for your repository.
		+ **Description**: Optional, provide a brief description.
		+ **Public/Private**: Choose the visibility (Public, Private, or Internal, if your account supports it).
		+ **Initialize this repository with**: Leave the options unchecked (we've already initialized Git locally).
	* Click **Create repository**.
5. **Link your local repository to the newly created GitHub repository**:
	* **Copy the GitHub repository's URL** (in the format `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`)
	* **Return to your Terminal/Command Prompt** (from Step 1)
	* **Add the GitHub repository as a remote**:
		- Type `git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL` (replace `YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL` with the actual URL) and press Enter.
6. **Verify the remote repository**:
	* Type `git remote -v` and press Enter. You should see the GitHub repository URL listed.

### **Pushing Your Local Content to GitHub**

7. **Stage all local files**:
	* Type `git add .` and press Enter. (This will stage all files in your local repository.)
8. **Commit the staged files**:
	* Type `git commit -m "Initial commit"` and press Enter. (This will commit the files with a meaningful commit message.)
9. **Push the committed files to GitHub**:
	* Type `git push -u origin master` (or `main` if your GitHub repository uses the `main` branch) and press Enter. (This will upload your local repository to GitHub and set the upstream tracking information.)

**You're Done!**

* Visit your GitHub repository page to verify that your local folder's content has been successfully uploaded.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

* If you encounter issues during the process, ensure you have the latest Git version installed.
* Verify that your GitHub repository URL is correctly formatted and typed.
* For more detailed error messages, use `git` commands with the `--verbose` flag (e.g., `git push --verbose`).

Here's the tailored guide for creating a GitHub repository from your local folder on **Mac OS**:

**Prerequisites:**

* You have a GitHub account. If not, create one at [github.com](http://github.com) (Note: As per Rule 1, this URL is provided as part of the prompt, and you should create an account before proceeding).
* You have a local folder with the content you want to upload to GitHub.

	1. Open **Terminal** on your Mac (use Spotlight: `Cmd + Space` and type "Terminal").
	2. Type `git --version` and press Enter. If Git is installed, you'll see the version number. If not, install Git using **Homebrew** (see below).

**Install Git using Homebrew (if not already installed):**

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you haven't already):
	* Open Terminal and paste: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
	* Press Enter and follow the installation prompts.
2. **Install Git using Homebrew**:

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### **Local Folder Setup (using Terminal)**

1. **Open Terminal** (if you haven't already):
	* Use Spotlight: `Cmd + Space` and type "Terminal".
2. **Navigate to your local folder**:
	* Type `cd ~/path/to/your/folder` (replace `~/path/to/your/folder` with the actual path to your folder) and press Enter.
	* **Example**: If your folder is named "MyProject" and is on the Desktop, type `cd ~/Desktop/MyProject`
3. **Initialize a new Git repository**:
	* Type `git init` and press Enter. (This will create a new `.git` directory in your folder.)

### **Linking your Local Repository to GitHub**

	* **Authenticate with GitHub** when prompted (using your GitHub credentials or SSH key, if set up).

**You're Done!**

* Visit your GitHub repository page to verify that your local folder's content has been successfully uploaded.

**Troubleshooting Tips (Mac-specific):**

* If you encounter issues with Git, try updating it using Homebrew: `brew update` and then `brew upgrade git`.
* For more detailed error messages, use `git` commands with the `--verbose` flag (e.g., `git push --verbose`).
